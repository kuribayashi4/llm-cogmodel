Character count: Each word has a fixed number of characters, and the reading time can be estimated based on the number of characters.\n2. Word length: The length of each word can be used to estimate the reading time, as longer words generally take longer to read.\n3. Frequency of occurrence: Words that occur more frequently in a language tend to be read faster, as readers are more familiar with them.\n4. Part-of-speech tagging: Words can be categorized based on their part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.), and the reading time can be estimated based on the part of speech.\n5. Dependency parsing: The dependencies between words in a sentence can be analyzed to estimate the reading time, as words that are dependent on other words may take longer to read.\n6. Named entity recognition: Words that refer to specific entities (such as names, locations, organizations, etc.) may take longer to read, as readers need to process the information.\n7. Word sense disambiguation: Words can have multiple meanings, and the reading time can be estimated based on the context and the meaning of the word.\n8. Coreference resolution: Words that refer to other words or phrases in the sentence can take longer to read, as readers need to understand the relationships between the words.\n9. Sentiment analysis: The sentiment of a word can affect the reading time, as words with negative or positive sentiment may take longer to read.\n10. Text classification: The category of the sentence (such as informative, persuasive, etc.) can affect the reading time, as readers may read sentences differently depending on their purpose.\n\nIn the given sentence, the tokens and their IDs in order of their reading cost (high to low) during sentence processing are:\n1.

Frequency-based methods: These methods use the frequency of each word in a corpus to estimate its reading time. The words with higher frequency are expected to be read faster.\n2. Word length-based methods: These methods use the length of each word to estimate its reading time. Longer words are expected to take longer to read.\n3. Character-based methods: These methods use the number of characters in each word to estimate its reading time. Words with more characters are expected to take longer to read.\n4. Machine learning-based methods: These methods use machine learning algorithms to learn the relationship between the words and their reading times. The algorithms can be trained on a corpus of text and then used to predict the reading time for new words.\nThe results of these methods can be used to create a ranking of the words in the sentence based on their estimated reading time. The words with the highest estimated reading time can be considered the most difficult to read, while the words with the lowest estimated reading time can be considered the easiest to read.\nIn the example sentence provided, the words can be ranked in the following order based on their estimated reading time:\n1. 'But' (330)\n2. 'first' (326)\n3. 'let' (323)\n4. 'me' (317)\n5. 'examine' (333)\n6. 'the' (326)\n7. 'head' (333)\n8. 'of' (323)\n9. 'this' (330)\n10. 'monster' (367)\n11. 'said' (329)\n12. 'the' (326)\n13. 'Lord' (347)\n14. 'of' (323)\n15. 'the' (326)\n16. 'Manor' (385)\n\nNote that these estimates are based on the assumption that the words are read at a constant speed and do not take into account any other factors that may affect reading time, such as the reader's familiarity with the words or the", "Predict the reading time (ms) for each whitespace-separated word in the following sentence:\nBesides, it was almost as cold at home as outside, for
