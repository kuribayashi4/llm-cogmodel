reading order matters in sentence processing?</s> \nReading order matters in sentence processing because it affects the interpretation of the text. When a reader encounters a word, they use contextual cues to infer the meaning of that word. However, if the reading order is changed, those contextual cues are altered, and the meaning of the text can be impacted. For example, in the sentence \"I know you will go away when the match burns out!\", changing the reading order from the beginning of the sentence to the end (\"when the match burns out!') would result in a loss of meaning because the context of \"you\" is lost.", "Suppose humans read the following sentence: \"Of the hundreds of witnesses that the various researchers interviewed, a seemingly

By examining the order in which tokens are read, we can gain a deeper understanding of the cognitive processes that underlie language processing. Additionally, the reading cost of a given sentence can affect its overall processing speed and clarity for humans, which can be important in fields such as reading comprehension and communication.\n\nUnderstanding the reading costs of various sentences can also be useful in applications such as language translation, machine learning algorithms, and speech recognition. By understanding the cognitive processes that underlie human language processing, we can improve our algorithms and systems to better understand and generate natural language.", "Suppose humans read

during sentence processing refers to the time and cognitive resources required to process them. High-cost reading requires more attention and processing resources, whereas low-cost reading requires less. This means that the sentence with the highest-cost reading will likely be the most difficult for humans to process and comprehend. \n\nNatural language processing algorithms typically rely on low-cost reading strategies, as they can process sentences more efficiently and quickly. However, this approach may not always lead to accurate comprehension, as certain high-cost words may be crucial to the overall meaning of the sentence. \n\nTherefore, it is important to consider the reading cost of words during sentence processing to ensure that the algorithm can effectively understand the meaning of the sentence without sacrificing efficiency or speed.", "Suppose humans read the
