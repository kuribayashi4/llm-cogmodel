trend that tokens with longer forms (e.g. noun phrases, prepositional phrases, and verbs) tend to have higher reading costs than shorter tokens (e.g. articles, conjunctions, and function words). This makes sense given that the longer tokens may require more processing effort in terms of lexical lookup, semantic interpretation, and integration into the broader context of the sentence. Additionally, the distribution of tokens may vary by sentence type or topic, so these examples may not be representative of all natural language processing tasks.", "Suppose humans read the following

reading order of tokens may not always follow their order in the sentence. For example, in the second example, \"Poor little Aqua\" is listed before \"frightened\" although it appears later in the sentence. This is likely due to the fact that the word \"poor\" is shorter and more common than the word \"frightened\", making it easier to process.\n\nAdditionally, punctuation and discourse markers such as \"during\" or \"and\" can affect the reading order of tokens. In the third example, the sentence contains the words \"during the nineteen eighties and nineteen nineties\", which may slow down processing.\n\nIt is also possible that the specific lexicon or structure of the sentence can impact the reading order. For example, in the fourth example, the word \"conspiracies?\" may be harder to process than other words in the sentence due to its unusual structure.", "Suppose humans read the following sentence:

based on frequency (high to low)?\nOne possible reason why reading order based on processing cost (high to low) might be preferable for sentence understanding is that it can better capture the complexity of reading sentences. Some words may have a low frequency but still be difficult to process, such as long words or words with multiple syllables. Reading order based on processing cost can better capture the difficulty level of individual words and how they affect the overall processing difficulty of a sentence. This can be important in understanding how people read and comprehend complex texts.", "Suppose humans read the following sentence: \"Besides, it was almost as cold at home as outside, for they had

and how can they be optimized for faster reading?</s> \nThe reading cost of a token during sentence processing depends on various factors such as its position in the sentence, its length, the frequency of occurrence, and the complexity of the word. These factors can be optimized to reduce the reading cost and improve reading speed.\n\nOne approach is to use a lexical analyzer to categorize words into common groups and identify which ones are likely to require more processing time. This can be achieved through various techniques such as stemming, lemmatization, and part-of-speech tagging.\n\nAnother approach is to reduce the frequency of uncommon words or use abbreviations instead, especially for common terms that have shorter substitutes. For example, \"nineteen\" can be replaced with \"19\" or \"nineteen eighty-four\" can be replaced with \"1984\". This approach can help to reduce the reading cost without sacrificing semantic accuracy.\n\nAdditionally, prepositional phrases can be reduced to their main verb or noun, and phrases can", "Suppose

algorithm based on the given sentences because the cost varies between sentences and depends on the specific context and meaning. However, a possible explanation is that the reading cost for a sentence may depend on the complexity of the language used, the length of the sentence, the frequency of the words, and other factors.

to demonstrate the process of word reading and to show how word order can affect the reading cost during sentence processing. The exercise shows that reading the same sentence can vary in the order of the tokens that have a higher or lower reading cost, which can impact the overall comprehension of the sentence. This can help researchers and educators understand how reading comprehension can be affected by different factors such as sentence complexity, vocabulary, and the order of words in a sentence.", "Suppose humans read the following sentence: \"Besides, it was almost as cold at home as outside, for they had only a patchy roof to cover them.\" \nList the tokens and their IDs in order of their reading cost (high to low) during sentence processing.\nToken ID:\n0: Besides,, 1: it, 2: was, 3: almost, 4: as, 5: cold, 6: at, 7: home, 8: as, 9: outside,, 10: for, 11: they, 12: had, 13: only, 14: a, 15: patchy, 16: roof, 17: to, 18: cover, 19: them., \nAnswer:\n9: outside,, 19: them., 0: Besides,, 17: to, 15: patchy, 6: at, 16: roof, 8: as, 1: it, 5: cold, 7: home, 11: they, 10: for, 18: cover, 14: a, 13: only, 2: was, 4: as, 12: had, 3: almost,\n\nSuppose humans read the following sentence: \"Poor little Aqua, frightened by the impending cold and darkness, wished he could sleep not in the sky, but somewhere closer to earth.\" \nList the tokens and their IDs in order of their reading cost (high to low) during sentence processing.\nToken ID:\n0: Poor, 1: little, 2: Aqua,, 3: frightened, 4: by, 5: the, 6: impending, 7: cold, 8: and, 9: darkness,, 10: wished, 11: he, 12: could, 13: sleep, 14: not, 15: in, 16: the, 17: sky,, 18: but, 19: somewhere, 20: closer, 21: to, 22: earth., \nAnswer:\n22: earth., 2: Aqua,, 3: frightened, 6: impending, 9: darkness,, 0: Poor, 19: somewhere, 7: cold, 5: the, 8: and, 10: wished, 11: he, 18: but, 15: in, 4: by, 16: the, 14: not, 1: little, 13: sleep, 12: could, 17: sky,, 21: to, 20: closer,\n\nSuppose humans read the following sentence: \"During the nineteen eighties and nineteen nineties, a new narrative emerged which was at strong odds with what was reported in nineteen forty-seven.\" \nList the tokens and their IDs in order of their reading cost (high to low) during sentence processing.\nToken ID:\n0: During, 1: the, 2: nineteen, 3: eighties, 4: and, 5: nineteen, 6: nineties,, 7: a, 8: new, 9: narrative, 10: emerged, 11: which, 12: was, 13: at, 14: strong, 15: odds, 16: with, 17: what, 18: was, 19: reported, 20: in, 21: nineteen, 22: forty-seven., \nAnswer:\n21: nineteen, 22: forty-seven., 10: emerged, 0: During, 2: nineteen, 3: eighties, 5: nineteen, 14: strong, 4: and, 11: which, 6: nineties,, 9: narrative, 19: reported, 12: was, 8: new, 7: a, 15: odds, 13: at, 20: in, 17: what, 18: was, 1: the, 16: with,\n\nSuppose humans read the following sentence: \"But it was still clear he was moving towards the side he wanted, despite the disappointing performances against Italy and Wales.\"\nList the tokens and their IDs in order of their reading cost (high to low) during sentence processing.\nToken ID:\n0: But, 1: it, 2: was, 3: still, 4: clear, 5: he, 6: was, 7: moving, 8: towards, 9: the, 10: side, 11: he, 12: wanted,, 13: despite, 14: the, 15: disappointing, 16: performances, 17: against, 18: Italy, 19: and, 20: Wales.,\nAnswer:\n15: disappointing, 14: the, 13: despite, 16: performances, 17: against, 18: Italy, 19: and, 20: Wales., 11: he, 12: wanted, 9: the, 10: side, 8: moving, 7: towards, 6: it, 5: was, 4: still, 3: clear, 2: but, 1: it, 0: was,"]}
