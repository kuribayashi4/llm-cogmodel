For example, in the first sentence, the topic is about matches, so the probability of tokens like \"match\" and \"match burns out\" is higher. In the second sentence, the topic is about a little girl rubbing a match on a wall, so the probability of \"rubbed\" and \"on\" is higher.\n\n- Token frequency: The probability of a token appearing in context could also depend on its frequency in the language.

by incorporating information about surrounding words and phrases. Part-of-speech tagging can be improved by assigning tags based on the context surrounding the token, such as the grammatical function of the token within a sentence or the presence of nearby nouns or verbs. For example, the word'match' can be assigned a different part-of-speech tag in the second sentence ('when the match burns out') than in the third sentence ('It was a short stubby match'), based on the surrounding words and the overall meaning of the sentence.", "Suppose you read the following sentence: \"Of the hundreds of witnesses that the various researchers interviewed, a seemingly impressive

and its corresponding algorithms in real-world applications such as text classification, summarization, machine translation, or natural language processing in general?</s> \nAs language models, we rely on statistical and probabilistic techniques to process natural language data. These algorithms enable us to accurately interpret and derive meaning from text, which is crucial for various real-world applications such as text classification, summarization, machine translation, and natural language processing. Statistical parsing is an example of a task that can be used in these applications to process and extract information from natural language data. The probability distributions can be used to assess the likelihood of events occurring in a given context, which is highly valuable information for machine learning systems. Additionally, the conditional probabilities can be used to infer new knowledge from prior knowledge, which is useful in tasks such as summarization and document classification. Overall, statistical parsing and related probabilistic algorithms have many practical applications in natural language processing and are essential for developing intelligent systems that can understand human language.", "Suppose you read the following sentence: \"Of the hundreds of witnesses that the various researchers interviewed, a seemingly impressive figure, a comparable few were true 'witnesses' who claimed to have actually seen debris or aliens.\" \nList the tokens and their IDs in order of their probability in context (low to high).\nToken ID:\n0: Of, 1: the, 2: hundreds, 3: of, 4: witnesses, 5: that, 6: the, 7: various, 8: researchers, 9: interviewed,, 10: a, 11: seemingly, 12: impressive, 13: figure,, 14: a, 15: comparable, 16: few, 17: were, 18: true, 19: 'witnesses', 20: who, 21: claimed, 22: to, 23: have, 24: actually, 25: seen, 26: debris, 27: or, 28: aliens., \nAnswer:\n0: Of, 15: comparable, 11: seemingly, 4: witnesses, 26: debris, 19: 'witnesses', 13: figure,, 28: aliens., 7: various, 2: hundreds, 18: true, 12: impressive, 8: researchers, 16: few, 14: a, 6: the, 1: the, 10: a, 5: that, 20: who, 21: claimed, 27: or, 17: were, 24: actually, 9: interviewed,, 25: seen, 22: to, 3: of, 23: have,\n\nSuppose you read the following sentence: \"I know you will go away when the match burns out!'\" \nList the tokens and their IDs in order of their probability in context (low to high).\nToken ID:\n0: I, 1: know, 2: you, 3: will, 4: go, 5: away, 6: when, 7: the, 8: match, 9: burns, 10: out!', \nAnswer:\n10: out!', 8: match, 0: I, 4: go, 9: burns, 1: know, 3: will, 5: away, 6: when, 2: you, 7: the,\n\nSuppose you read the following sentence: \"It was a short, stubby match that the little girl next rubbed on the wall.\" \nList the tokens and their IDs in order of their probability in context (low to high).\nToken ID:\n0: It, 1: was, 2: a, 3: short,, 4: stubby, 5: match, 6: that, 7: the, 8: little, 9: girl, 10: next, 11: rubbed, 12: on, 13: the, 14: wall., \nAnswer:\n11: rubbed, 10: next, 3: short,, 5: match, 0: It, 1: was, 4: stubby, 8: little, 14: wall., 7: the, 12: on, 2: a, 6: that, 9: girl, 13: the,\n\nSuppose you read the following sentence: \"But it was still clear he was moving towards the side he wanted, despite the disappointing performances against Italy and Wales.\" \nList the tokens and their IDs in order of their probability in context (low to high).\nToken ID:\n0: But, 1: it, 2: was, 3: still, 4: clear, 5: he, 6: was, 7: moving, 8: towards, 9: the, 10: side, 11: he, 12: wanted,, 13: despite, 14: the, 15: disappointing, 16: performances, 17: against, 18: Italy, 19: and, 20: Wales.,\nAnswer:\n13: despite, 17: against, 16: disappointing, 18: performances, 15: against, 12: that, 6: moving, 8: towards, 0: But, 2: he, 9: side, 4: clear, 11: he, 5: was, 14: Wales., 7: the, 10: side, 1: it, 19: Italy,"]}
