The sentence with the highest token cost is the sentence in which the phrase \"not almost\" is repeated, which takes the largest weight. The other exception is the sentence in which the phrase \"approximately\" is the most commonly used word, which takes the third-highest cost.", "Suppose humans read the following sentence: \"Besides,
