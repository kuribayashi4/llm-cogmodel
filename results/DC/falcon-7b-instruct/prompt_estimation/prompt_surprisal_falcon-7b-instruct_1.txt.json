'The' is a definite article that names the noun or pronoun referred to in previous sentences. 'it' is an indefinite article that can refer to any one or multiple nouns. 'The' and 'an' are articles that can modify preceding nouns to show possession or non-possession respectively. 'In' connects two independent clauses that share the same noun. 'or' connects two independent clauses with a comma as the sentence is not structured to connect the two clauses as a single sentence. 'which' and 'that' are conjunctions that can connect two clauses or phrases in order to create a relation. 'have' is a modal verb that shows the completion of a subordinate clause. 'the' is a definite article that names the noun or pronoun referred to in the previous sentence. 'as' is a preposition that can connect two clauses with a single sentence. 'is' is an article that can represent a single noun. 'the' and 'that' are articles that can modify preceding nouns to show possession or non-possession respectively. 'in' connects two independent clauses. 'which' and 'that' are conjunctions that can connect two clauses or phrases in order to create a relation. 'are' is a conjugation of the verb that shows the completion of a subordinate clause.
