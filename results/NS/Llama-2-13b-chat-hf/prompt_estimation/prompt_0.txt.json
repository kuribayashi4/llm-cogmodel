greater difficulty. The reading cost of a token is determined by its frequency of occurrence in the language, as well as its position in the sentence and the context in which it appears.\n\nIn general, the reading cost of a token is higher if it is less common, appears in a less common position, or is in a less familiar context. For example, the token \"vapor\" is likely to have a higher reading cost than the token \"is\" because \"vapor\" is a less common word than \"is\". Similarly, the token \"Do\" is likely to have a higher reading cost than the token \"you\" because", "Suppose humans read the following sentence: \"This week, a new work from Elizabeth Wurtzel is in
