lower reading cost than later tokens. The ID of each token is used to look up its corresponding reading cost in the token's dictionary entry.\nIn the example sentences above, the tokens are listed in the order of their reading cost, from lowest to highest. This allows us to determine the most likely sequence of tokens that a human reader would use when processing the sentence.\nFor example, in the sentence \"The Lord believed the second huntsman had tried to steal the first huntsman's prize and so proclaimed the first huntsman the true victor,\" the tokens with the lowest reading cost are \"the,\" \"and,\" and \"so,\" which are likely to be processed first. The tokens with higher reading costs, such as \"Lord,\" \"believed,\" and \"prize,\" are likely to be processed later in the sentence.\nBy understanding the reading cost of each token in a sentence, we can better analyze and understand how humans process language, and how language processing algorithms can be improved to more accurately simulate human language comprehension.", "Suppose humans
