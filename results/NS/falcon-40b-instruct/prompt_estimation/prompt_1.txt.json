\nAnalyzing the reading cost of tokens and their IDs during sentence processing can provide insights into the cognitive processes involved in language comprehension. By examining how the brain processes different components of language, we can gain a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying language understanding. Additionally, analyzing the reading cost of specific words or phrases can be useful for identifying potential sources of difficulty in language comprehension for individuals with certain impairments or language disorders.", "Suppose humans read the following sentence: \"Parliament has only itself to blame if its proceedings are such a turn-off.\" \nList the tokens and their IDs in order of their

the difficulty of processing natural language sentences?</s> \nThe concept of \"reading cost\" provides insight into the difficulty of processing natural language sentences by revealing the effort required for humans to interpret and understand specific words and phrases in a sentence. By analyzing the order in which tokens are read, we can gain a better understanding of how difficult certain words and phrases are to process, which in turn helps us better understand how human cognitive processing differs from computational models of language processing. Additionally, measuring reading cost can help inform language models and natural language processing algorithms, leading to more accurate and efficient processing of text in various contexts.",
