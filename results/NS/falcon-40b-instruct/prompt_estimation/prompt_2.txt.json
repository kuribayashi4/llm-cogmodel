a token in a sentence is not only affected by its position in the sentence but also by its content and context within the sentence. The content and context of the token in a sentence can affect the cognitive processing cost of reading and understanding it, which can have an impact on its reading cost.\n\nIn the first example, the reading cost of the token \"indeed\" is likely to be lower than the reading cost of the token \"whether\" because \"indeed\" has a clear meaning and context, and it can quickly convey information to the reader. However, the reading cost of the token \"whether\" is likely to be higher because it requires more cognitive processing to understand its meaning and context within the sentence.\n\nSimilarly, the reading cost of the token \"US\" in the second example is likely to be higher than the reading cost of the token \"going\" because \"US\" requires more cognitive processing to understand its context within the sentence, such as its meaning and relevance to the argument being discussed.\n\nSimilarly, the reading cost of the token \"water\" in the third example is likely to be lower than the reading cost of the token \"doughnut,\" as it requires less cognitive processing to understand its meaning and context within the sentence.\n\nIt is important to note that the reading cost of a token can vary based on the context and complexity of the sentence it is in. In some cases, a relatively simple token can have a high reading cost if it is surrounded by complex or confusing text", "Suppose humans read the following sentence: \"The question is whether the US

dealing with natural language?\nThe reading cost for the same tokens may vary across sentences because of the complexity of the sentence structure, the presence of new or rare words, and the context in which the sentence is read. For example, the reading cost for the token \"act\" in the first sentence may be higher than in the second or third sentence because it requires more processing time and effort to understand the meaning in the context of the sentence. Similarly, the reading cost for the token \"doughnuts\" may be higher in the second and third sentences than in the first because they are less familiar or have a more complicated meaning than the word \"doughnuts\" in the first sentence. Additionally, the reading cost may also be influenced by the reader's knowledge and background, as well as the purpose of reading the text.", "Suppose humans read the following sentence: \"The

of tokens during sentence processing in Natural Language Processing?</s> \nThe purpose of identifying the reading cost of tokens during sentence processing in Natural Language Processing is to optimize the algorithm for faster and more efficient processing of natural language. By identifying the most difficult tokens for the algorithm to process, the system can be improved by either making those tokens easier to understand or by focusing on their importance in the overall meaning of the sentence. This can help with tasks such as information retrieval, machine translation, and automatic summarization.", "Suppose humans read the following sentence: \"The question is whether the US is going to
