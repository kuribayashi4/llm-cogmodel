way that mimics human capabilities. This requires the extraction of meaningful information from text, which can be done through the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as tokenization. Tokenization is the process of dividing a text into meaningful units or tokens, typically words, which can then be used for further processing such as part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition. In the context of NLP, tokenization is an essential step and plays a critical role in the extraction of meaningful information from text.", "Suppose you read the following sentence: \"This week, a new
