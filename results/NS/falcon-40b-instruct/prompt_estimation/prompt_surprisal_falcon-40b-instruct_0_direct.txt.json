(USE). Here's how you can calculate surprisal in Python:\n\n1. Install USE by running `!pip install use-package`.\n2. Load the package in your script: `use = UniversalSentenceEncoder()`\n3. Define a function that takes in the input sentence and returns the surprisal:\n\n``` python\ndef get_surprisal(sentence):\n    token_ids = use(sentence)\n    token_counts = torch.zeros_like(token_ids)\n    token_counts.scatter_(0, token_ids.unsqueeze(0), 1)\n    surprisal = torch.sum(token_counts * torch.log2(token_counts + 1e-9)) / torch.sum(token_counts + 1e-9)\n    return surprisal.item()\n```\n\n4. Apply the function to the input sentence: `surprisal = get_surprisal(sentence)`\n\nThe above code first tokenizes the input sentence using USE. Then, it initializes an empty tensor to store the token count. It multiplies the token count tensor with the", "Predict the surprisal (bit) for each whitespace-separated word in the following sentence:\nThis week, a new work from Elizabeth Wurtzel is in the
