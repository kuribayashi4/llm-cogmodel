generated by a machine?\nYes, it is possible to use token frequency to detect if a given sentence is written by a human or generated by a machine. Machine-generated text tends to have a more even distribution of token frequencies, with no significant variations in frequency for each token. Human-generated text, on the other hand, may have variations in token frequencies, with some tokens appearing more frequently than others. Additionally, machine-generated text may contain repeated phrases or sentences, while human-generated text usually does not.", "Suppose you read the following sentence: \"Alcohol- related illnesses.\"
