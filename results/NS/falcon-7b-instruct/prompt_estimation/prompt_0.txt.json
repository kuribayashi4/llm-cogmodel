cost (low to high) for each token. The above sentences have the highest reading costs for each token. In the first sentence, \"Alcohol- related illnesses,\" the word \"related\" has a reading cost of 0.13, which is lower than the word \"Alcohol,\" which has a reading cost of 0.16. The word \"Huntsman,\" the word \"huntsman\" in the second sentence, has a reading cost of 0.22 and the word \"Wet behind the ears\" has a reading cost of 0.02. Therefore, the overall reading cost for the sentence is 0.24. In the last sentence, \"Hunting boar in the woods.\" the word \"boar's\" has a reading cost of 0.12 and the word \"reputation\" has a reading cost of 0.22.

word and token used in the sentence. In general, the more unique and difficult to process words in the sentence, the higher the cost of processing them. Similarly, words that occur more frequently in a sentence are also more likely to have a higher cost. In addition, the amount of context in the sentence can also play a role in the cost of processing. If there is a large amount of surrounding text or the sentence contains many unique and difficult to process tokens, the processing cost will likely be higher. \n\nIn general, natural language processing tasks can range from relatively low cost (processing a small subset of a sentence) to much higher cost (processing a very complex sentence with many unique tokens) depending on the language and specific sentence.", "Suppose humans read the following sentence: \"This week, a new work from Elizabeth Wurtzel is in the bookshops, recounting her latest addiction, this time to Ritalin, the

By using heuristics, linguists and language models can determine which sentences are easier to process and which ones are more difficult to understand. The order in which tokens and their IDs are being processed can affect the sentence's overall reading cost. In a sentence with a large number of token IDs to process, the sentences can become much more expensive to read than simple sentences with few tokens. By optimizing sentence processing, developers can improve text readability, which makes the text easier to read and understand by users.", "Suppose humans read the following sentence: \"This week, a

sentence processing, cost is a measure of how much a particular type of word or token impacts the reading difficulty of the sentence. The higher the cost of a word or token, the more difficult it is to read the sentence containing that word or token.\nIn addition to the previously mentioned dependencies, the order of the cost of tokens in a sentence can also have an impact on the sentence processing. This order is based on the order of their reading cost, where high-cost words or tokens are easier to read than low-cost words or tokens. This ordering is known as the \"word familiarity\" or \"lexical similarity\" and may affect sentence processing and comprehension.", "Suppose humans read the following sentence: \"This week, a new
