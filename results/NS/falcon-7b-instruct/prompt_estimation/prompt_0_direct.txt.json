In particular, the word 'proof' may benefit from optimizations due to its high reading cost, the word 'boar' might benefit from oronyms, and so on. In this example sentence, the word 'proof' is likely assigned a reading cost analogous to its spelling (i or o), while word 'boar' may benefit from the differences in pronunciations, meanings, or associations. Considering their high reading costs, the words 'What', 'can', 'to', and 'boar' may be primed to be parsed earlier in the sentence. Similarly, the word 'ulterior', with its baseline reading cost as 373, may benefit from being parsed earlier in the sentence too. These differences in cost and usability should be integrated into any parsing strategies to detect and manage the text efficiently.", "Predict the reading time (ms) for each whitespace-separated word in the following sentence:\n'No, it's fine.

We can ignore that keyword aside from its root meaning.

Below is an example of such a task where the'skip' step is required:\n\n\"However, it cannot be done with the ceiling alone, so I would like anyone in safety\nto come up with feasible solutions to\nthe problem in the best way it can be done. \"\n\nIn this sentence, the user is requesting that the ceiling cannot be lowered, so if anyone can come up with a \"feasible solution\" to the problem, the same is required by reading each word or constructing the sentences.\n\nThe'skip' step is a processing strategy that ensures that the processing does not take place based on irrelevant data or metadata. It siphons off unnecessary tasks to prevent the processing from processing tasks that are no longer important. This minimizes the processing time and processing steps required in solving the problem.\n\nIn summary, the'skip' step is a process step that allows the processing of tasks that may consume much time, and skips over possibly redundant or unnecessary steps.", "Predict the reading time (ms) for each whitespace-separated word in the following sentence:\n'No, it's fine.

By considering the reading time of alternative splits, the sentence can be pitted against other sentence options to provide a combinatorial heuristic for more accurate parsing decisions.\nAccurate parsing requires the accurate prediction of sentence tokens, specifically the poky or a-part whole word each time new text is encountered. This can be time-consuming, particularly when large documents are involved. For example, the sentence 'The article column has grown significantly in the last year. Its average breadth had grown from X to X' can be parsed correctly without error and without much time by treating it as a single word token, a proper split of the sentence, and\nspelling this is a simple mode of document filtering; finally, it is likely to be a suitable candidate for heuristic token splitting in many text analytics applications. Unfortunately, even canonical splitting has its issues, since a small alteration to any text can instantly affect extant word boundaries and make accurate parsing difficult. As a result, metalanguage override, or learning (across linguistic subsets), is routinely relatively cheap", "Predict the reading time (ms) for each whitespace-separated word in the following sentence:\n'No, it's fine.

So, the classification of the sentence can provide how many tokens would be included in the sentence. Here, five different tokens are used in the sentence.\n\nSo, if we categorize this sentence in terms of the above-ondoing clauses, it would be:\n\n- The sentence as a whole is 75.5 characters long.\n- The argument of the sentence is radiated as is going on with a character[s] rather than a suggestion (as is the case with the case). There are four cases rather than an individual.\n- There are five different iterating tokens, including the aforementioned 'the', 'next', 'years', 'Over', and \"the\".\n- There is only one different vocabularisation as the sentence is using a sequence of words for example.\n- Moving now to the sentence processing time, it turns out that applying the prepositions \"over\" and \"the\" can add to the clearly low processing time in segmenting this sentence. And the processing time is only 1", "Predict the reading time (ms) for each whitespace-separated word in the following sentence:\n'No, it's fine.

A word is closer preferentially to a phoneme with a similar Read triangle.\n2. Words pertaining to the role of a tag or role model (or words in the French language) are usually less frequent.\n3. Because writing is more limited in time, some commonly used writers (or words related to writing) are more frequent and closer to the beginning of the sentence (hence the difference in reading cost for orthography).\n4. These are usually not a word like number/colour/letter but a common word in informal use.\n5. The real filth of words (in terms of grammar) is French/English, except English being a Latin descendant.\nWithin FASTTEXT, the embeddings for the words \"ans\" and \"in\" are certainly more near the beginning than our English. Also, English emergent vocabulary is nestled quite away from formalisation. So, the less formal speech is genuinely popular and likely to cause the higher reading cost\n\nThe rules of FastTEXT are based on:\n- Again, Crutchfield's rule: The wider the word, the better the slot index differences are. For example, the slot in the sherbet thank you, surprised word, is initially clustered around the important word in the sentence so effortlessly well.\n- But this is specific to orthography too. In the sentence, French is two syllables rather than one, so the frequency of the \"anglais\" word in the sentence is reduced. This word being contrived is furthermore a French origin word.\n- French word with a frequency of 3-10 is a quick bribe to fastetching.", "Predict the reading time (ms) for each whitespace-separated word in the following sentence:\n'No, it's fine.
