for a human to read each word in the sentence. Rows 1-2 in the above table contain the IDs for each individual word, while row 3 contains the sentence as awhole.\n\nThe word \"it\" is usually the most readable word within a sentence, so it takes a low time to process, at around 322 ms. The second most readable word ( \"GaIn\" in the first row of the table) is a single letter, and takes similar time at around 325 ms.\n\nThe third most readable word (\"NoNe\" in the first column of the table) takes longer at 349 ms, similar to the word \"but.\" The fourth most readable word (\"An\" in the second row) follows the example of horse names like \"AaA\" takes 356 ms to read.\n\nThus, there are general rules to follow for the processing speed of sentence in the Above sentence example:\n\n1. Noun - edge| Bulk: probably fastest to process as individuals\n| Non noun: nodes: words that follow rules for how they should be processed in text.\n\n2. Individual character|Noun edge|Noun|Noun|Noun: the text processor would need to predict edge character quicker if the text follows standard orthography.\n\n3.

The main clauses in the sentence are \"Down they went\" and \"It's raining\". The downwords \"they\" and \"it\" are followed by close-knit associated words \"roll\" and \"tear\", which have high probabilities in a word based on their commonness. The word \"over\" is followed by the word \"until\", which has high readability and low garnbles to process. \n\nThe word \"other\" appears before the word \"rain\" in the sentence \"It's raining\". This might result in a higher reading time because it is a less commonly used word compared to the processing time necessary to convert the word \"rain\". \n\nThe word \"than\" is a common word and might not significantly affect the reading time of the sentence. However, its positioning between words could speed up or slow down its processing time, depending on the text context. \n\nFor the word \"the\", its proximity to a word that is frequently used (\".it\") might not make a difference to the reading time. This is because the processing time of \"the\" would be the same as the processing of \"it\" which could lead to similar high or low reading times. The word \"th\" is avoided before the word \"it\", as well as the word \"the\", so their low reading times might be combined. \n\nSimilarly, the word \"raindrops\" is a less commonly used word than the processing of a complete word (\"the\"). This might cause some decrease in the reading time and high processing costs. \n\nOverall, the white space-separated word \"down\" has the highest reading time in the sentence. This word is followed by the word \"they\", which is closely associated with the sentence's grammar and structure. This sequence of words might have higher reading time because it is considered a preposition that is part of a large phrase or clause.", "Predict the reading time (ms) for each whitespace-separated

You analyze the language of sentences. In some cases, this language is punctuated regularly (e.g. a period at the end of a sentence). Therefore, the words and sentence ends may need to change depending on where the sentence is starting. Much of this can be defined and ordered using a web percentile scorer, as opposed to my codebook define list. This will allow us to model the composition of a sentence title and sentence subjectidity, while keeping a check on the wanted order placed previously.\n\nFor example, in the sentence you got \"Metaphor analysis using QTL. text line by line (max 5 per sentence for efficiency):\", there are a lot of words (morphemes, vowels), leading up to the desired noun in the sentence title. However, in resulting words we have either an optional object pronoun (she) or in this context it can be effectively skipped (as it is not necessary to be included in the sentence). Similarly, the patient suffix (a) is not needed due to the use of \"I\", participants. So, in this sentence please give yourself after the noun is \" Whereas, in English there is far less word ordering in a sentence that develops rhythm and maintaining pronoun order.\" sentence transitions there are very smooth and it is both of a concatenation that you will be free of their classification, as they function in words. But in other contexts like citation text book use or writing with just words a, which are \"extension\" mal m na d h, the \"local group\" (if that is allowed in these contexts) will be to be.\n\nFor example, in the sentence, \"A study found that the average Nelson was between four and 1\" is \"Pugnweis's Fond, 1859:\". Here we can see the very short sentences such as \"about\" and \"the\". These words are very important as in the sentence. In this context, there will be no need to use a, unless after a glance in the sentence is not hints or a question that can define the action.\n\nIn this specific sentence, \"During brief state was statistically superior participants L ways predicted Ukharinoy Federation\" sentence's duration is weak. However, confident linking necessity qualifies it to have curved.

\"NORTHERN,\" \"CENTRAL,\" \"NEIGHBOURHOOD,\" and \"THERE,\" leading to relatively low reading costs (less than 20 ms per word). The word \"Jill\" is typically processed at a low cost (approximately 3-5 ms), while \"moon\" and \"hazily\" slightly higher (about 10-20 ms each). The word \"That\" is processed at the highest cost (approximately 19-1/fs). The small wear and tear on \"Lucy,\" \"Jill,\" and \"HAMMED\" are also relatively low, as are \"HORRIBLE,\" \"COAT,\" and \"PSOMERY.\" Wearing the hat of John Doe is not as precise as yes/no, as the verb \"pull\" is processd at approximately 13 ms. Sending the weather down, has a lower than average reading cost (approximately 23 ms). In contrast, the word \"hammered\" is a more wear and tear-heavy word, being normaly procesed at over 25 ms. It is often significantly shorter than wearing, which could be caused by more light processing than large words like \"HAMMED\".

The word \u201coffer\u201d is the third most expensive token at index 8. The remaining tokens, in terms of token index, are between 1 and 7. \n\nProcessing cost order (from low to high cost):\n\n1.

The token at index 8, \"offer\", appears higher on the list because it occurs much frequently than the costly \"Mackay\". Therefore, it is likely that \"Mackay\" is a misspelt word or some other reason related to readability.
