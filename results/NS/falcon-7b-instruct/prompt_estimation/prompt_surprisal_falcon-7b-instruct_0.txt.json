director. He is the director of numerous films, most notably Black Swan (2010) and Requiem for a Dream (2001), as well as several smaller-budgeted projects. The \"Aronofsky Method\", which is a method of filming with which the director has become known, involves shooting a film from a \"first-person point of view\", often with the camera mounted on the body of the protagonist. Some of his other notable works include 2001's psychotropic drama Memento, the religious drama Dogma, the horror films The House of the Devil and The Witch, and most recently, the biblical drama Mary Magdalene, which was released in May 14, 2020. Aronofsky is known for his work with actors like Ellen Burstyn, Russell Crowe, Jared Leto, and Bradley Cooper, which have been praised for their unique directorial techniques. He also directed Black Swan, his first film to receive widespread critical acclaim. In 2020, Aronofsky's Netflix movie The Irishman was released. The film received a 91% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes and grossed over 500 million dollars worldwide, making it one of the highest-grossing movies of the 2010s.\n\nThe \"Aronofsky Method\", which involves filming with the director's body-mounted camera, is arguably best represented in Black Swan, his debut film, which starred Lily James, Keira Knightly, Jessica Biel, and Eva Green. The film grossed over 400 million dollars worldwide and was nominated for several Academy Awards, including Best Director, Actress, Supporting Actor, Art Direction, and Production Design.\n\nThe \"Aronofsky Method\" was also a key element in his other films, notably in Requiem for a Dream, which starred Mickey Rourke, Jared Leto, Eva Green, and Bradley Cooper. The film was praised for its unique filming techniques and the performances of its actors.\n\nIn 2020, Aronofsky released a Netflix movie called The Irishman. The film starred Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci, and grossed more than 500 million dollars worldwide. It received high praise for its realistic portrayal", "Suppose you read the following sentence: \"This week, a new work from Elizabeth Wurtzel is in the bookshops, recounting her latest addiction, this time to Ritalin, the drug given to hyperactive children.\" \nList the tokens and their IDs in order of their probability in context (low to high).\nToken ID:\n0: This, 1: week,, 2: a, 3: new, 4: work, 5: from, 6: Elizabeth, 7: Wurtzel, 8: is, 9: in, 10: the, 11: bookshops,, 12: recounting, 13: her, 14: latest, 15: addiction,, 16: this, 17: time, 18: to, 19: Ritalin,, 20: the, 21: drug, 22: given, 23: to, 24: hyperactive, 25: children., \nAnswer:\n15: addiction,, 19: Ritalin,, 11: bookshops,, 7: Wurtzel, 12: recounting, 6: Elizabeth, 1: week,, 0: This, 4: work, 14: latest, 22: given, 16: this, 9: in, 24: hyperactive, 2: a, 8: is, 20: the, 5: from, 3: new, 21: drug, 25: children., 13: her, 10: the, 18: to, 23: to, 17: time,\n\nSuppose you read the following sentence: \"When we got back from our waterfall trip, we found him on the hotel terrace drinking beer and dealing with his fan mail.\" \nList the tokens and their IDs in order of their probability in context (low to high).\nToken ID:\n0: When, 1: we, 2: got, 3: back, 4: from, 5: our, 6: waterfall, 7: trip,, 8: we, 9: found, 10: him, 11: on, 12: the, 13: hotel, 14: terrace, 15: drinking, 16: beer, 17: and, 18: dealing, 19: with, 20: his, 21: fan, 22: mail., \nAnswer:\n0: When, 6: waterfall, 13: hotel, 18: dealing, 21: fan, 10: him, 14: terrace, 2: got, 15: drinking, 1: we, 16: beer, 9: found, 11: on, 20: his, 4: from, 3: back, 7: trip,, 5: our, 22: mail., 19: with, 17: and, 8: we, 12: the,\n\nSuppose you read the following sentence: \"Of course this is something to do with the fact that most women don't look like Blanchett or Minogue, and tend to be in a state of permanent anxiety about their appearance.\" \nList the tokens and their IDs in order of their probability in context (low to high).\nToken ID:\n0: Of, 1: course, 2: this, 3: is, 4: something, 5: to, 6: do, 7: with, 8: the, 9: fact, 10: that, 11: most, 12: women, 13: don't, 14: look, 15: like, 16: Blanchett, 17: or, 18: Minogue,, 19: and, 20: tend, 21: to, 22: be, 23: in, 24: a, 25: state, 26: of, 27: permanent, 28: anxiety, 29: about, 30: their, 31: appearance., \nAnswer:\n16: Blanchett, 18: Minogue,, 2: this, 0: Of, 20: tend, 14: look, 4: something, 9: fact, 11: most, 25: state, 23: in, 28: anxiety, 12: women, 13: don't, 5: to, 27: permanent, 6: do, 17: or, 24: a, 15: like, 19: and, 8: the, 3: is, 31: appearance., 22: be, 30: their, 29: about, 7: with, 21: to, 10: that, 1: course, 26: of,\n\nSuppose you read the following sentence: \"Her father had been mean and moody ever since his wife had gone to meet her Maker.\" \nList the tokens and their IDs in order of their probability in context (low to high).\nToken ID:\n0: Her, 1: father, 2: had, 3: been, 4: mean, 5: and, 6: moody, 7: ever, 8: since, 9: his, 10: wife, 11: had, 12: gone, 13: to, 14: meet, 15: her, 16: Maker.,\nAnswer:\n Gesch\u00e4ftsspiel herunterladen.

after a word in the document (e.g. 'predict a word') is given in Table 5. The text is the first half of the text of a document in which the last word is 'the', with some word tokens from the document's preprocessing step. Each word is associated with a set of indices in the text, to specify which words to process in text-processing tasks involving the document's text (e.g. for document summarization tasks, which words are most important). Each word is defined as its text indices starting at the first non-blank character to include in the document's text, ending at the end of the word. All the text indices are assigned IDs corresponding to the indices assigned in the document's preprocessing step (i.e. [1, 2, 3, etc.], in this example, the indices are assigned one based on the word length: [25, 24, 23, etc.]), each corresponding to one of the indices in the set. The indices in the text indices are assigned IDs based on the number of words assigned to the indices. This document processing step is useful for document summarization tasks, for which the relevant parts of the text to highlight may be the nouns (e.g. \"The company was founded in 1997.\"). The text indices used to process the document's text are assigned in a way that preserves their relation to the document's indices, so that the indices can be retrieved from the document itself at a later stage (e.g. to annotate the document using a sentence-length classification, or to use them as features in a machine learning model).\nThe text indices may be assigned to any relevant sub-text of the document. For example, for document summarization tasks, where the relevant parts of the text are the nouns, the indices should be assigned to the nouns themselves.\nUser", "Suppose you read the following

today. Both have won numerous awards and have become iconic figures in their respective film industries. But despite their fame and fortune, women in the industry are often faced with the perception that they are 'unsexy' in order to maintain their work opportunities. The notion of'sex appeal' is not just limited to the realm of entertainment either - women are also pressured to maintain a certain image in the workplace to prove themselves and prove their competence. How can we shift away from these harmful stereotypes?\" \n2. \"Perhaps the media's emphasis on body image and appearance is responsible for the high pressure that women face today - the pressure to look perfect, to be skinny and attractive, or else to be perceived as a failure. While there has been a shift in the perception of women's roles in society, the beauty and fashion industries, and the media, still reflect some of the gender-based stereotypes that were created to define 'femininity' in the past. This pressure is not only on women, but also on their loved ones. Research shows that partners and family members can exert a significant amount of pressure on women to maintain their appearance. How can this pressure be eased and eliminated?\" \n3. \"For many women, it is difficult to challenge these stereotypes and to question what we are taught about ourselves. There is a growing awareness that is needed, however, which is encouraging. Women are more likely to be proactive in their careers and to feel a sense of equality in terms of their rights and opportunities. As women push to challenge and disrupt stereotypical roles, there is a hope that society will be able to see and appreciate women for their full potential, beyond beauty and appearance.\" \n4. \"How can society move beyond the pressure on women to constantly look a certain", "Suppose you read the following sentence: \"This week, a new work from Elizabeth Wurtzel is in the bookshops, recounting her latest addiction, this time to Ritalin, the drug given to hyperactive children.\" \nList the tokens and their IDs in order of their probability in context (low to high).\nToken ID:\n0: This, 1: week,, 2: a, 3: new, 4: work, 5: from, 6: Elizabeth, 7: Wurtzel, 8: is, 9: in, 10: the, 11: bookshops,, 12: recounting, 13: her, 14: latest, 15: addiction,, 16: this, 17: time, 18: to, 19: Ritalin,, 20: the, 21: drug, 22: given, 23: to, 24: hyperactive, 25: children., \nAnswer:\n15: addiction,, 19: Ritalin,, 11: bookshops,, 7: Wurtzel, 12: recounting, 6: Elizabeth, 1: week,, 0: This, 4: work, 14: latest, 22: given, 16: this, 9: in, 24: hyperactive, 2: a, 8: is, 20: the, 5: from, 3: new, 21: drug, 25: children., 13: her, 10: the, 18: to, 23: to, 17: time,\n\nSuppose you read the following sentence: \"When we got back from our waterfall trip, we found him on the hotel terrace drinking beer and dealing with his fan mail.\" \nList the tokens and their IDs in order of their probability in context (low to high).\nToken ID:\n0: When, 1: we, 2: got, 3: back, 4: from, 5: our, 6: waterfall, 7: trip,, 8: we, 9: found, 10: him, 11: on, 12: the, 13: hotel, 14: terrace, 15: drinking, 16: beer, 17: and, 18: dealing, 19: with, 20: his, 21: fan, 22: mail., \nAnswer:\n0: When, 6: waterfall, 13: hotel, 18: dealing, 21: fan, 10: him, 14: terrace, 2: got, 15: drinking, 1: we, 16: beer, 9: found, 11: on, 20: his, 4: from, 3: back, 7: trip,, 5: our, 22: mail., 19: with, 17: and, 8: we, 12: the,\n\nSuppose you read the following sentence: \"Of course this is something to do with the fact that most women don't look like Blanchett or Minogue, and tend to be in a state of permanent anxiety about their appearance.\" \nList the tokens and their IDs in order of their probability in context (low to high).\nToken ID:\n0: Of, 1: course, 2: this, 3: is, 4: something, 5: to, 6: do, 7: with, 8: the, 9: fact, 10: that, 11: most, 12: women, 13: don't, 14: look, 15: like, 16: Blanchett, 17: or, 18: Minogue,, 19: and, 20: tend, 21: to, 22: be, 23: in, 24: a, 25: state, 26: of, 27: permanent, 28: anxiety, 29: about, 30: their, 31: appearance., \nAnswer:\n16: Blanchett, 18: Minogue,, 2: this, 0: Of, 20: tend, 14: look, 4: something, 9: fact, 11: most, 25: state, 23: in, 28: anxiety, 12: women, 13: don't, 5: to, 27: permanent, 6: do, 17: or, 24: a, 15: like, 19: and, 8: the, 3: is, 31: appearance., 22: be, 30: their, 29: about, 7: with, 21: to, 10: that, 1: course, 26: of,\n\nSuppose you read the following sentence: \"'Why not?'

The sentence is most likely in the pattern of I(or) (or) is, I (or) handed (or) him the nickel back or that, I(or) was not (or) hungry. Therefore, the sentence is most likely in the token order: I handed him the nickel back and told him that I was not hungry.", "Suppose you read the following sentence: \"This week, a new work from

followed by \"got,\" \"that,\" and \"an.\" \"Got\" means \"to receive or obtain by gift or inheritance,\" \"that\" means \"the fact or circumstance existing or occuring which has not been explained,\" and \"an\" means \"an idea, plan, or purpose.\" The sentence is structured as a declarative sentence and contains a subordinate clause, \"that he.\" This sentence is composed of the main verb \"was\" and a subordinate verb \"to be.\" The word \"that\" is used to define the action as occurring", "Suppose you read the following sentence: \"This week, a new work from Elizabeth Wurtzel is in the
