The next sentence, \"may you do your best to help us\", uses \"may\" with a lower probability, but because it is not a standalone word, it appears after the subject and verb (\"who\" and \"try\"). In contrast, the sentence \"Abby, who was breathing fire all on account of the little snail, tried to ignore her\" uses the word \"Abby\" again, which is a prominent character name, after \"Breathing fire\", which has a lower frequency, making it a subordinate word. It appears after a subordinate word (\"snail\") with a lower frequency and is therefore more dependent on its location in the sentence.", "Suppose you read the following sentence: \"During the fuss
